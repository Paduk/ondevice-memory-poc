# HVP18 external-adaptation record

HVP18 is an **externally adapted, model-assembled pilot**. It is
excluded from training and does not qualify as a human-authored evaluation
set. Its external records do not overlap with any other external-adapted HVP pilot.

- All 50 turns carry an external source trace.
- 40 turns preserve the source text verbatim
  with only speaker-role normalization.
- 10 turns append the minimum information needed to express
  a persistent, self-contained VehicleMemBench preference.
- The V2 memory operations and quizzes are newly authored for this pilot.
- Audio2Tool's non-commercial license applies to this adaptation.

The exact record IDs, original turn text, downloaded-file SHA-256 values, and
reuse mode are preserved in `scenario-source.json`.
